<span class="float-right">![Lullabot - Grammy.com]({{ page.image }})</span> You'll find this post in your `Lullabot.com "Lullabot is excited to announce its fourth annual redesign and relaunch of GRAMMY.com! Just in time for the 55th Grammy Awards this Sunday, February 10th, this year's site features a complete redesign, as well as an upgrade to Drupal 7 leveraging Panels and Views 3.x, some cool, fullscreen, swipeable photo galleries and other mobile-web bells and whistles. The site is also fully responsive, allowing the 40 million+ expected viewers to stream, share, and interact across any web or mobile device. Special congratulations to Acquia for hosting GRAMMY.com for the first time, as well as to our good friends over at Ooyala for once again delivering the site’s archive video content, and to AEG for delivering the live stream video via YouTube.

Simultaneously tune in to every aspect of music’s biggest night so you won’t miss a thing: awards news, video, pictures, artist info, Liveblog posts, thousands of tweets-per-minute and behind-the-scenes action.

The GRAMMY Live stream starts tomorrow, Friday February 8th at 5pm ET / 2pm PT, so you can spend all weekend with the website as you gear up for the CBS telecast on Sunday night. Don't miss any of the GRAMMY action this weekend!

We'll be watching and tweeting along from @lullabot. Follow us on Twitter and let us know what you think."
